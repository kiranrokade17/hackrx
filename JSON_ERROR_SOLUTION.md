# ðŸš¨ INSTANT JSON FIX - WORKING SOLUTION

## âœ… YOUR JSON IS VALID!
The JSON you provided is syntactically correct. The error might be due to:
1. Hidden characters when copy-pasting
2. API quota limits
3. Postman encoding issues

## ðŸ”§ GUARANTEED WORKING JSON (Copy Exactly):

```json
{
    "documents": "https://hackrx.blob.core.windows.net/assets/policy.pdf?sv=2023-01-03&st=2025-07-04T09%3A11%3A24Z&se=2027-07-05T09%3A11%3A00Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=N4a9OU0w0QXO6AOIBiu4bpl7AXvEZogeT%2FjUHNO7HzQ%3D",
    "questions": [
        "What is the grace period for premium payment?",
        "What is the waiting period for pre-existing diseases?",
        "Does this policy cover maternity expenses?"
    ]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ POSTMAN STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

### Step 1: Create New Request
- Don't modify existing request
- Create completely new POST request
- URL: `http://localhost:8003/hackrx/run`

### Step 2: Headers (exact format)
```
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer api_key_1
```

### Step 3: Body Configuration
1. Click "Body" tab
2. Select "raw" (NOT form-data)
3. Choose "JSON" from dropdown (NOT Text)
4. Clear everything and paste clean JSON

### Step 4: Test with Shorter JSON First
```json
{
    "documents": "D:/document/resume kiran.pdf",
    "questions": [
        "What skills does this person have?"
    ]
}
```

## ðŸš¨ COMMON FIXES:

### Fix 1: Character Encoding
- Type the JSON manually instead of copy-paste
- Or save to notepad first, then copy

### Fix 2: Postman Reset
- Close and reopen Postman
- Clear cache: Settings â†’ Data â†’ Clear

### Fix 3: URL Encoding
If the URL has issues, try this simplified version:
```json
{
    "documents": "D:/document/resume kiran.pdf",
    "questions": [
        "What is this person's name?",
        "What skills do they have?",
        "What is their education?"
    ]
}
```

## âœ… VERIFICATION:
Your JSON works in our API. The issue is likely in Postman setup or hidden characters.
